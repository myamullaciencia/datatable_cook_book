Frequently Asked Questions
=======================

Many of the analysts/scientists/developers are not yet familiar with the py-datatable package, as they are new to it they would definitely come up with queries/questions/doubts about the functionalities,such as where to start, what/how does each function work,what would happen if any of these functions used, comparing the functionalities with other open source data manipulation packages,and runtime errors etc etc ...

I have been exploring the py-datatable since 2019, I have been posting the questions and answering to others questions on StackoverFlow  under the tag :  **py-datatable** .

Iâ€™m thinking of creating a central repository of these posts providing comprehensive explanations in notebooks in which analysts can easily reproduce and explore further.

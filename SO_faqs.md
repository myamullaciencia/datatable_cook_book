Frequently Asked Questions
=======================

Py-datatable is new to the analysts/scientists/developers communities, since it is new to them they would definitely have queries/questions/doubts about the functionalities,such where to start, what/how does each function work, runtime errors,what would happen if any of these functions used, comparing the functionalities with other open source data manipulation packages etc etc ..

I have been exploring the py-datatable since 2019, I have been posting the questions and answering to others questions on StackoverFlow  under the tag :  **py-datatable**

Iâ€™m thinking of creating a central repository of these posts with the comprehensive explanations in notebooks where analysts can easily reproduce and explore further.

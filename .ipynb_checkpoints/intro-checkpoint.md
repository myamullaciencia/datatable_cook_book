Data Wrangling using py-datatable
============================

Python datatable module is the right tool for the task. It is a library that implements a wide and growing range of operators for manipulating two-dimensional data frames. It focuses on: 

- big data support

- high performance

- both in-memory and out-of-memory datasets

- multi-threaded algorithms. 

In addition, datatable strives to achieve good user experience, helpful error messages, and powerful API similar to R data.table’s.

Here are some other silent features as - 

1. Concise syntax: fast to type, fast to read

2. Fast speed

3. Memory efficient

4. Careful API lifecycle management

5. Support from H2O’s team and growing community

6. Open sourced project
